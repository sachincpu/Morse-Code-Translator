# Morse-Code-Translator

Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.

Algorithm

The algorithm is very simple. Every character in the English language is substituted by a series of ‘dots’ and ‘dashes’ or sometimes just singular ‘dot’ or ‘dash’ and vice versa.
